This is a log for my Python projects

When I accomplish something, I write a * line that day.

Whenever a bug / missing feature / idea is mentioned during the day and I don't fix it, I make a note of it and mark it with ? (some things get noted many times before they get fixed).

Occasionally I go back through the old notes and mark with a + the things I have since fixed, and with a ~ the things I have since lost interest in.

? Trying to set a cron job to pull only the .plan file from the github repo.
    ! There's no access to cron jobs for PythonAnywhere accounts, just scheduled tasks, on a fixed time for free accounts, with more flexible settings for paying accounts. 
Changed the example bottle app to serve my .plan file. +pythonanywhere +bottle
* Setup a git repo for the projects to be run here. https://github.com/oevl/pythonanywhere.git +pythonanywhere
* Fixed a regex definition in PyOrgMode and now I can use it to create scheduled org-mode files. https://github.com/oevl/PyOrgMode +tblcks
